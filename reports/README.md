# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

`![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)`

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

or

```bash
uv add typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the

### Question 3
> **A requirement to the project is that you include a third-party package not covered in the course. What framework**
> **did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

--- We used the third-party framework SHAP. It was integrated by adding one function call after model training, which is defined in visualize.py. It uses KernelExplainer to analyze how each wine chemical property (alcohol, flavanoids, etc.) affects KNN predictions across all three wine classes. The implementation generates a ranking showing overall feature importance. This makes sense for your MLOps project because it provides model interpretability — understanding why the model classifies wines helps validate the model works correctly and identifies which chemical measurements matter most for wine classification. Other than SHAP we used scikit.learn as well as matplotlib. scikit.learn is used to build a supervised machine learning classifier using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The approach is chosen to have a relatively simple model we can ensure works in order to keep the focus on designing and implementing an end-to-end MLOps pipeline, which is the primary objective of this project. matplotlib is used to create static visualizations and plots. ---

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>

> Answer:

--- Dependencies in the project were managed using a Python virtual environment combined with uv as the dependency manager. All project dependencies and their exact versions are defined in a pyproject.toml file, with a corresponding lock file generated automatically by uv. This ensures that all team members use identical package versions, eliminating the meme “works on my machine” issues and improving reproducibility. To set up an exact copy of the development environment, a new team member would follow a simple and well-defined process. First, the repository is cloned from version control. Next, a virtual environment is created locally. Once inside the project directory, the command uv sync is executed. This command reads the lock file and installs all required dependencies into the virtual environment with the correct versions. After activation of the virtual environment, the project is immediately ready to run without any manual package installation. This approach provides a fast, and reproducible setup process, making onboarding straightforward and ensuring consistency across development machines and operating systems. ---

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

--- The project was initialized using the cookiecutter MLOps template. From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the src/ml_ops_59 package with the core machine learning logic, including modules for data loading, model definition, training, evaluation, and visualization. We have deleted the notebooks folder as this was not useful for this particular project. We deviated from the template by adding several components that were not included by default. We added a configs/ folder with Hydra configuration and sweep files. We also added a wandb/ directory and logging utilities for experiment tracking. Additional root-level scripts for dataset statistics, data drift detection, and model registry reporting were introduced---

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

--- For linting and formatting, we used Ruff, configured through the project configuration, to enforce PEP 8–compliant formatting, consistent import ordering, removal of unused imports, and detection of common errors such as undefined variables. These checks are automatically executed in our GitHub Actions workflows to ensure code quality is maintained across all contributions. We also experimented with mypy, however it was added too late in the process. These concepts are important in larger project as they help different developers understand each others code, and enshures that it is sat up in the same way. Additionally it is very valuable when you are trying to understand code written by others. While mypy was not implemented, we have tried to add decriptions where it is necessary. We also tried to add type hints, however this is not done consistenly.  ---

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

--- In total, ten tests were implemented. Six tests focus on data validation, ensuring that the dataset loads correctly, contains the expected columns, has no missing or duplicate values, and that both features and class labels are numeric and within reasonable ranges. The remaining four tests target the model and training pipeline, verifying correct KNN model creation, valid and reproducible training accuracy, and that model predictions have the correct output shape. Together, these tests validate both data integrity and model reliability. The ten tests are naturally not exhaustive but gave us a clear understanding of how to work with tests and try to predict what could go wrong in data and model implementation ---

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

--- Total code coverage is around 46%. We would not trust that our code is error free with a coverage of 100% because the testings have to be clever and well thought for it to be error free. We cannot predict every error that we run into so there will naturally be some ongoing debugging/error solving as we execute the code.  Coverage only tells us that lines were executed during tests, not that the tests contain strong assertions or validate the right behavior. It is possible to reach high coverage with weak tests that do not catch logical errors. Thus, even with high coverage we can not be sure the code is fully operatable---

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

--- Branches and pull requests were limited used in this project, as development was done directly on the main branch- This is also because our group was working close together in the project so we could ealisy align the work being done. Using branches and pull requests could have improved version control. Branches allow features or fixes to be developed in isolation, while pull requests enable code review and safer integration, reducing the risk of errors and improving collaboration. Branches and pull request were only used when we implementing workflows that trigges when data and the model changes. ---

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

--- Yes, we used DVC for managing data in our project. We configured DVC to store data in Google Cloud Storage buckets. Conceptually DVC improved our project by enabling reproducibility and efficient collaboration. It is smart in its ability to version our datasets alongside our code in Git, permitting us to track exactly which data version was used for each model training run. This can be particularly valuable when debugging model performance issues, as we could easily roll back to previous data versions to identify whether problems stemmed from code changes or data changes. Another smart aspect is that the `.dvc` files stored in Git are lightweight metadata files that point to the actual data in cloud storage, keeping our repository small while maintaining full version control. However our dataset in this case was relatively small and did not change during the project work. It is a feature we will keep in mind for future projects. ---

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

--- We have organized our continuous integration into multiple GitHub Actions workflows, each responsible for a specific aspect of quality assurance and automation. One workflow focuses on code quality, where we run linting and formatting checks using Ruff to ensure consistent style and catch common programming errors. Another workflow is responsible for running unit tests, where we execute the test suite using pytest. This workflow validates the correctness of core functionality such as data loading, model training, evaluation logic. We run the same checks on multiple operating systems ubuntu, windows, and macos-latest and a fixed Python version. This helps ensure that the project behaves consistently across different environments.Anexample of a triggered workflow can be seen here:https://github.com/AlbertFrydensberg/ML_Ops_59/actions/runs/21249105272
We also have an example where the workflows fails here:https://github.com/AlbertFrydensberg/ML_Ops_59/actions/runs/21245542513
in this case we can see where the error occurs and fix it. ---

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

--- Experiments were configured and tracked using Weights & Biases (W&B) instead of static configuration files. Hyperparameters such as the number of neighbours, train–test split, and random seed were logged for each run. Hyperparameter optimisation was performed using W&B sweeps. Experiments were executed from the command line, for example: python train.py and sweeps were launched using wandb sweep sweep.yaml
wandb agent <our-sweep-id> ---

### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

--- Reproducibility was ensured primarily through systematic experiment tracking using Weights & Biases (W&B). For each experiment, all relevant hyperparameters (such as the number of neighbours, train–test split, and random seed) as well as performance metrics were automatically logged in the WandB webside. This ensured that no information was lost between runs and that results could be traced back to the exact configuration that produced them. Additionally, fixed random seeds were used in data splitting to make experiments deterministic. W&B also stores timestamps, code versions, and run histories, which allows experiments to be compared and revisited at a later time. To reproduce an experiment, one can rerun the training script using the logged hyperparameters or relaunch a specific W&B run directly. Combined with version control in Git, this setup provides a clear and reproducible experimental workflow. ---

### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**
> **inspiration from [this figure](figures/wandb.png). Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are**
> **important.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.

> Example:
> *As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.*
> *As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...*

### Question 15

> **Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your**
> **experiments/project? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the*
> *training docker image: `docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64`. Link to docker file: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

---  We developed two Docker images: one for training and one for API deployment. Both Dockerfiles use the `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.12-bookworm-slim` base image for fast dependency management with uv, and implement cache mounting for faster rebuilds, as shown in the guide. We separated these into two distinct Dockerfiles because they serve different purposes. The training container runs batch jobs to train models and needs write access to save checkpoints. The API container runs continuously as a web service to serve predictions to users. It uses unicorn for web acess. We initially considered creating a separate evaluation Dockerfile, but since evaluation is already integrated into our training pipeline (train.py), a separate container would be redundant. This is something we'll be aware of in future cases. All Dockerfiles use the `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.12-bookworm-slim` base image for fast dependency management with uv. To run the training docker image: `docker run --rm train:latest` Link to docker file for training: <https://github.com/AlbertFrydensberg/ML_Ops_59/blob/main/dockerfiles/train.dockerfile>  ---

### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>
> Answer:

---  Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used the continuous integration setup and found errors when commiting code to github and others ran the experiements, found errors and tried to backtrack the errors by printing statements in the code or running only parts of the script. We also did some unit testing and model testing during the experiement phase at we could not foresee all the tests required for our code before be began to run the experiments. We also ran single profiling at some point on our train.py which showed that almost everything was 0.000, and we interpreted that as - either the script did very little work, or the expensive part wasn’t executed from that entry point. But we think it could be a usefill check in the future when working with way larger datasets and training setups to see where the most extensive runtimes are and identify potential optimisation areas in our code. ---

## Working in the cloud

> In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.

### Question 17

> **List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

GCS was used to store datasets and experiment artefacts. The storage bucket served as a central, versioned data backend, integrated with DVC, allowing data to be shared consistently between local development and cloud-based compute resources. Compute Engine was used for model training. By creating CPU-based VMs, training could be executed on scalable cloud hardware without being limited by local resources. This allowed experiments to run for longer durations and with higher compute capacity when needed. Cloud Run was used to deploy a FastAPI application. Cloud Run provides a fully managed, serverless environment for running containerised web services, enabling the FastAPI backend to be deployed with automatic scaling and without manual infrastructure management.

### Question 18

> **The backbone of GCP is the Compute engine. Explained how you made use of this service and what type of VMs**
> **you used?**

> *using a custom container: ...*
>
> Answer:

We used the compute engine to run our KNN training with the CPU-based VMs, training could be executed on scalable cloud hardware without being limited by local resources. This allowed experiments to run for longer durations and with higher compute capacity although the higher capacity is not really needed for this project it is nice to know how to manage training when scaling.

>
> Example:
> *We managed to train our model in the cloud using the Engine. We did this by ... . The reason we choose the Engine*
> *was because ...*
>
> Answer:

--- Yes, the model was successfully trained in the cloud using Google Compute Engine. A virtual machine was created with a standard Ubuntu image and CPU resources, which was sufficient for the KNN model used in the project. Compute Engine was chosen because it provides a simple and transparent way to scale training while maintaining full control over the execution environment. After creating the VM, it was accessed via SSH and configured in the same way as the local development environment. The project repository was cloned from GitHub, dependencies were installed using the uv package manager to ensure environment reproducibility, and the dataset was downloaded from Google Cloud Storage using DVC. Training was then executed by running the existing training script directly on the VM. ---

--- One of the biggest struggles in the project was related to collaboration and version control practices. At several points, multiple group members worked directly on the same files on the main branch instead of using separate feature branches. This occasionally led to merge conflicts, some of which failed or required manual resolution. These conflicts were time-consuming and sometimes resulted in accidental overwrites or the need to reapply changes. We overcame this challenge by better communication, making sure that we were not working on the same at the same time. For future projects it would be a good idea to have a more stric branching discipline. Another major challenge in the project was integrating cloud storage using DVC. This step took a significant amount of time to implement, as understanding the underlying concepts of cloud storage buckets and configuring them correctly in Google Cloud proved difficult. In particular, setting up the remote storage, managing credentials, and ensuring that DVC could reliably push and pull data from the cloud required several iterations before it worked as expected. To be honest we just kept trying untill it worked .  ---
